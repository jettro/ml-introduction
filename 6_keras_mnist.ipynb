    "This architecture defines a simple fully connected feedforward neural network (also known as a multilayer perceptron, or MLP) using Keras. It is typically used for tasks like classification where input data is represented in a flat, non-spatial form (e.g., tabular data or flattened images). The model has two Dense layers, which are densely connected (also called fully connected) neural layers. The first Dense layer has 512 units and uses the ReLU activation function. The second (and last) layer is a 10-way softmax layer, which means it will return an array of 10 probability scores (summing to 1). Each score will be the probability that the current digit image belongs to one of the 10 digit classes."
